## Front-End
Cryptocurrency Charter was created with React and Material-UI on the front-end.

## Back-End 

## Deployment
This application is deployed via Github.io.

## APIs
I used the Coindesk API to pull bitcoin prices by specific currency and timeframe parameters.

# Coming Soon

This repo contains the first release. In the future, I would like to add:

- Support for other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

# Get started

```
npm run start
```

## Challenges
- This was my first attempt at using Material-UI, and as such had a bit of a learning curve. In the end, I found it very easy to use.


## Potential Improvements
- The chart sometimes has issues displaying previous data on mouse-over after you have changed the currency. At this point, I'm not sure why that is occurring, but I would like to fix it.
